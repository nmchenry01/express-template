/*
  Purpose:
    - The controllers can be thought of as "orchestrators" that connect routes to services
    - Express logic should end here, IE only data that the business logic needs to function is passed onward from here (no req/res, etc)
    - Example: Receives a request from a route and calls the database model responsible for creating a TODO object/entity
