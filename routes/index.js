/*
  Purpose:
    - This is where we will route requests to controllers, which ideally is a 1:1 relationship
    - Should contain absolutely no business logic or complexity
    - Each route should represent an endpoint for the API
    - Example: Routes a /todo/:id request to the todo.getTodo controller, etc
